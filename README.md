# Telling Stories with Data

#### A Data Science Portfolio Site for Samuel T. Shanks, PhD

<br><br>

If you are actually reading the Readme.md file for this GitHub repo,
then you are likely something of a coding nerd. I am always looking to
learn from my more experienced comrades, so if you would like to
exchange wisdom, [you can reach me via email quite
easily.](mailto:sshanks@fastmail.fm)

### A Few Disclaimers:

-   This site is designed to be accessible to anyone with a curious mind
    and an interest in data. I am hoping to show off how I approach
    communicating data insights to non-data-junkies. If you want to see
    "how the sausage got made," I have left links in the project-pages
    to the code I used (typically in the form of Jupyter notebooks) to
    clean, explore, and visualize the data
-   I am a relentlessly curious person, and I live to learn new things.
    As a result, the work found here will always show a bit more breadth
    than depth. I can do depth; I have a PhD, but that is not want I am
    doing here. This is my sandbox where I get to play.
-   This is a portfolio site, not a peer-reviewed journal. While I
    welcome emails from folks who notice errors, the primary purpose
    here is to demonstrate how I approach data science & data
    communication. I have not done extensive QA-work on the data itself.
    Re-use the data found here at your own risk.

### How did I do this?

GitHub Pages sites are generated using Jekyll, which is a Ruby-based
static-site generator. There are a number of open-source Jekyll themes
out there, but this one is called [What a
Theme](https://thedevslot.github.io/WhatATheme/) was developed by the
smart folks at [thedevslot](https://github.com/thedevslot).

I hit a few hiccups getting things rolling, but updating all of my
dependencies seemed to allow the "<http://localhost:4000/admin>" feature
to start working. This provides some GUI-based access to the
site-building features, but it is pretty thin, and I mostly used it to
help learn the system. Ultimately it is just as easy to write & edit the
pages/posts/yml in VS-Code or R-Studio.
