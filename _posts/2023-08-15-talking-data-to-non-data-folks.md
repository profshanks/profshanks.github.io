Those of us who love to explore the world of data and quantitative reasoning often feel as if we are speaking a different language, and while that is not strictly-speaking true, we are DEFINITELY speaking in a dialect that is frequently unintelligible and alienating to many of the other folks that we work with. We need to do better...

#### Sam's 5 key takeaways:

-   We are communicating with talented, intelligent people, who just happen to communicate differently.
-   If our insights are going to have an impact, we need to communicate them using language that is emotionally compelling to the folks who will be acting on those insights.
-   Community, curiosity, & confidence are key concepts in this process.

## Who Does the REAL Work?

Data analytics is technical, demanding work, and when I am in "success mode" I get to experience a sense of pride that makes me wonder why people don't bow respectfully when I walk by. Instead, my feeling of victory is usually a solitary one as most folks are not just disinterested in what I am doing, but in fact there is often a clear aversion to discussing.

Society is currently telling everyone that data is important, but that does not make the subject any less scary for most folks.

We need to remember that most of the time, those of us doing the data analytics work are not the people who do the work that brings in the revenue for their organization, and neither are we the ones who sit in the high-level positions where the decisions are being made. We represent an INVESTMENT of resources (payroll, equipment, etc.) made by an organization in the hopes of increasing efficiencies or unveiling opportunities that might have been missed otherwise. But the decision to actively pursue those opportunities will likely be made by a non-data person, and the opportunity itself will almost certainly be enacted by a non-data person. Which is to say, if we cannot communicate our ideas into the minds of non-data folk, then we are not actually doing anything useful.


## What Kind of Communication are We Seeking?

We can quibble all day about language that is clear, accurate, and we do indeed need to be able to "translate" our findings from the jargon-heavy world of statistics and code into something that the C-Suite folks can understand, but at the bottom of it all is the idea that we need to communicate in a manner that is emotionally compelling for the people who will be making the decisions and taking the actions.

We need to take the time to learn about how our colleagues do their work, what they care about, what they are good at. We should never be a divisive force in our organizations, on the contrary, we should strive to be the connective tissue (with dataframes and charts instead of collagen?).
