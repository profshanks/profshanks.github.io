#### Actionable Insights from this Project:

-   Retention surprises

<hr class="has-background-black">

## Introduction

#### Context
First to second year student retention has become the Holy Grail of Higher Education. Two generations ago, universities would boast of their "wash out" rates as an indicaiton of their quality ("Look left, look right, only one of the three of you will be graduating four years from now..."), now schools invest enormous amounts of time and attention to keep as many of those First Year students as they possibly can. And any strategy that can improve a university's "retention rate" tends to get the attention of high-level administrators.

Strategies for targeting "at risk" students abound as do the theories of how best to help those students once targeted, yet the tide has yet to turn, despite the increased attention. Part of the problem here has to do with the timing and methods for targeting the students who are likely to leave the university. Most targeting methods focus on either demographic characteristics such as race, gender, or income level; or they focus on academic performance, such as High School GPA, test scores, or first semester college grades. 

None of these methods directly account for one of the primary reasons why students leave: they just don't feel like they belong. Low academic performance in the first semester of college is as likely to be the result of a lack of social adhesion to the campus as it is an indication of academic ability, and the demographic characteristics that correlate with low First-Year retention numbers are rarely interrogated for their underlying causal factors: students coming to universities optimized for the comfort of upper-middle-class white students often feel like outsiders, and their sense of social adhesion suffers. In short, they don't feel as if they "belong."

#### The Proposition

What if we could identify students whose sense of belonging was already beginning to fall behind during their first month at the university? What if we could specifically target the students least-likely to return the following Fall during a period when their view of the university was still highly malleable?

What makes one student feel as if they belong tends to be as idiosyncratic as the students themselves. There are clearly trends, but claiming to understand "kids today" is obviously a dubious claim. But what if you could predict who would stay and who would go, without really understanding the reasons why? Just knowing with some precision which students might be most likely to depart would at least allow a university to target its resources most effectively, and that alone might be worth tens of thousands of dollars to the perpetually sagging bottom line of most university budgets.


#### The Project
The goal of this project was to try to assess whether or not the 1000 courses are helping the students in general terms.   

The courses examined in this study were as follows:
- SSP 1001: Reading Hacks for College (1 credit)
- SSP 1002: Managing Time and Stress (1 credit)
- SSP 1004: Studying, Note Taking, & Test Taking (1 credit)
- SSP 1052: Academic Reading and Writing at the College Level (3 credits)

#### The Data
At our institution, access to the data warehouse is strictly controlled, and we are not allowed to run our own SQL queries. Instead, we have to make text-based requests for data. This is what we requested:
- Beginning with the Fall 2018 semester we requested the student ID numbers for the students enrolled in the four courses, as well as their GPAs from the semester before they took the course.
- With each subsequent semester, we added the IDs of additional students, their prior GPAs, and we collected the GPA and enrollment status for all students in the list.
-We continued collecting this information for all of the students involved in the study through the Spring 2022 semester.
- We also collected an array of demographic & background data for each student.

## Data Cleaning & Exploration
Not everyone gets excited about data cleaning, but if you are one of those folks, you can [check out this Jupyter notebook](/SSP_Impact/Data_Cleaning) to see how I tackled this task.  

In short, I deleted an unnecessary column, recast the data types where needed, dealt with the null values, and otherwise made the world safe for data exploration.

### Data Exploration: Who are our Students?
Our dataset contained 745 rows, with 42 of those rows representing students where were returning for second & third semesters. The dataset therefore contains data on 703 unique students, who occupied 745 "seats" in our classes. For some of the following analyses, we will be looking at the data strictly according to unique-student data, whereas at other times, it will make more sense to look at the seats occupied.
