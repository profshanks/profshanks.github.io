#### Actionable Insights from this Project:

-   Students from LSBE & SCSE are under entolling. We might want to market the courses more aggressively to those student populations
-   The students we helped the most...
-   How did we help them?
-   1 credit vs 3 credits
-   Retention surprises

## Introduction

#### Context
The [Academic Writing & Learning Center](https://awlc.d.umn.edu) (AWLC) at the University of Minnesota Duluth is an academic unit that sits outside the University's four main colleges. The AWLC manages the University's Tutoring Center and Writers' Workshop, but also teaches a series of [1000 level courses](https://awlc.d.umn.edu/ssp-courses/ssp-course-offerings) designed to improve student success.

These courses are not designed to target struggling or at-risk students, but rather are aimed at the general student population; they represent an opportunity for any student to up their game academically.
<br><br>

#### The Project
The goal of this project was to try to assess whether or not the 1000 courses are helping the students in general terms.   

The courses examined in this study were as follows:
- SSP 1001: Reading Hacks for College (1 credit)
- SSP 1002: Managing Time and Stress (1 credit)
- SSP 1004: Studying, Note Taking, & Test Taking (1 credit)
- SSP 1052: Academic Reading and Writing at the College Level (3 credits)
<br><br>

#### The Data
At our institution, access to the data warehouse is strictly controlled, and we are not allowed to run our own SQL queries. Instead, we have to make text-based requests for data. This is what we requested:
- Beginning with the Fall 2018 semester we requested the student ID numbers for the students enrolled in the four courses, as well as their GPAs from the semester before they took the course.
- With each subsequent semester, we added the IDs of additional students, their prior GPAs, and we collected the GPA and enrollment status for all students in the list.
-We continued collecting this information for all of the students involved in the study through the Spring 2022 semester.
- We also collected an array of demographic & background data for each student.

## Data Cleaning & Exploration
Not everyone gets excited about data cleaning, but if you are one of those folks, you can [check out this Jupyter notebook](/SSP_Impact/Data_Cleaning) to see how I tackled this task.  

In short, I deleted an unnecessary column, recast the data types where needed, dealt with the null values, and otherwise made the world safe for data exploration.
<br><br>
### Data Exploration: Who are our Students?
Our dataset contained 745 rows, with 42 of those rows representing students where were returning for second & third semesters. The dataset therefore contains data on 703 unique students, who occupied 745 "seats" in our classes. For some of the following analyses, we will be looking at the data strictly according to unique-student data, whereas at other times, it will make more sense to look at the seats occupied.
