## Introduction

#### Context
The [Academic Writing & Learning Center](https://awlc.d.umn.edu) (AWLC) at the University of Minnesota Duluth is an academic unit that sits outside the University's four main colleges. The AWLC manages the University's Tutoring Center and Writers' Workshop, but also teaches a series of [1000 level courses](https://awlc.d.umn.edu/ssp-courses/ssp-course-offerings) designed to improve student success.

These courses are not designed to target struggling or at-risk students, but rather are aimed at the general student population; they represent an opportunity for any student to up their game academically.
<br><br>

#### The Project
The goal of this project was to try to assess whether or not the 1000 courses are helping the students in general terms.   

The courses to be examined in this study were as follows:
- SSP 1001: Reading Hacks for College (1 credit)
- SSP 1002: Managing Time and Stress (1 credit)
- SSP 1004: Studying, Note Taking, & Test Taking (1 credit)
- SSP 1052: Academic Reading and Writing at the College Level (3 credits)
<br><br>

#### The Data
At our institution, access to the data warehouse is strictly controlled, and we are not allowed to run our own SQL queries. Instead, we have to make text-based requests for data. This is what we requested:
- Beginning with the Fall 2018 semester we requested the student ID numbers for the student who participated in the four courses, as well as their GPAs for the semester before they took the course.
- With each subsequent semester, we added the IDs of additional students, their prior GPAs, and we collected the GPA and enrollment status for all students in the list.
-We continued collecting this information for all of the students involved in the study through the Spring 2022 semester.
- We also collected an array of demographic & background data for each student

## Data Cleaning & Exploration
Not everyone gets excited about data cleaning, but if you are one of those folks, you can [check out this Jupyter notebook.](/SSP_Impact/Data_Cleaning.md)  

Long-story-short, I deleted an unnecessary column, corrected the data types, dealt with the null values, and otherwise made the world safe for data exploration

## Analysis #1: GPA Impact



## Analysis #2: Retention & Graduation Rates



#### Middle

In which we do some feature engineering & write some functions

#### End

In which we try to quantify the impact of our courses

#### Sam's 5 key takeaways from this project:

-   The quality of [R-Studio's](https://support--rstudio-com.netlify.app) ecosystem likely drives the popularity of R as the language of choice for many scientists.
-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org) is a FABULOUS tool for technical and scientific publishing.
-   There are multiple ways to inject interactivity into the otherwise static world of GitHub Pages.
-   Never underestimate a scientist's passion for aesthetics.
-   Fortune favors the bold; I'm so glad I took a chance...
